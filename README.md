# Python Profilers
Experiments with **Cpu** profiling and __memory__ profiling

Profiling an application is a dynamic code analysis where we investigate the behavior of the given code or program using the collected data while the code runs. 
It helps to identify different sections of code that we must optimize 
	to increase the application performance, its speed, latency and decrease its memory footprint as well as resource consumption..
